Questions about NMR paper

G1, G1.5, G2, and G3 represent normalized adjacency matrices for different bond orders?
	per entry max over matrices

What is psi?

How is network trained to produce uncertainty? Presumably no uncertainty values are provided in the dataset, so how do you validate? Is this different than the error std?
	uncertainty is a reflection 

"Evaluation of uncertainty-preserving methods must take into account the fraction of data at a given uncertainty level when making predictions." Is this saying that the uncertainty prediction must take into account the % of data used for training?

Equation 3 specifies loss function to be minimized, but it seems in code that there are separate loss functions for mean and uncertainty?
	single loss function, but tried different methods using and not using uncertainty measurement

"11,616 13C nuclei had more than one measurement and 1013 1H nuclei had more than one measurement". How can a nucleus have multiple measurements? Isn't chemical shift a deterministic quantity of electrochemical environment?
	solvents change chem shift, stereochemistry changes chemical shift

data is super noisy 
user contributed
nmr shift data does not have stereochemistry
ab initio data takes into account stereochemistry
uncertainty metric standard deviation

means and standard deviations - how to evaluate? How accurate am i above threshold 
any method of evaluating 
set uncertainty level - if you allow prediction 90% of the time, how accurate am I? how does changing threshold change accuracy of prediction


NOTES:
try to find way to encode bond order - this makes huge difference!!
data is noisy - be wary of outliers, but to start with ignore it
plot distribution of errors - long tail of large errors reflection of data, not of you! some values radically wrong (don't get discouraged if MSE is high)
if featurize data and run through standard GNN, get reasonable initial value
